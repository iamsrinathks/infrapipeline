Certainly! Below is a simple design document for the provided Dockerfile. This document outlines the purpose, components, and considerations for the Dockerfile.

# Dockerfile Design Document

## 1. Objective

The objective of this Dockerfile is to create a lightweight Docker image that includes the necessary tools (`kubectl`, `helm`, `kustomize`) and a user-provided script (`your-script.sh`). The image is designed to be minimal, secure, and non-root, following best practices for containerization.

## 2. Components

### 2.1 Build Stage

#### Base Image
- Alpine Linux: `FROM alpine as builder`
  - A minimal and lightweight Linux distribution suitable for creating small Docker images.

#### Work Directory
- `/tmp`: `WORKDIR /tmp`
  - Temporary working directory for the build stage.

#### Tools Installation
- `apk --no-cache add curl tar`
  - Installs `curl` and `tar` for downloading and extracting tools.

#### Download and Extract Tools
- Copies and extracts `kubectl.tar.gz`, `helm.tar.gz`, and `kustomize.tar.gz`.
  - `tar -xzf kubectl.tar.gz`
  - `tar -xzf helm.tar.gz`
  - `tar -xzf kustomize.tar.gz`

### 2.2 Final Stage

#### Base Image
- Alpine Linux: `FROM alpine`
  - A minimal and lightweight Linux distribution for the final image.

#### Copy Binaries
- Copies binaries from the build stage to the final image.
  - `kubectl`, `helm`, `kustomize` are copied to `/usr/local/bin/`.

#### Copy Script
- Copies the user-provided script (`your-script.sh`) to `/usr/local/bin/`.

#### User Setup
- `adduser -D nonrootuser`
  - Creates a non-root user named `nonrootuser`.

#### Set Non-root User
- `USER nonrootuser`
  - Sets the non-root user for subsequent commands.

#### Command
- `CMD ["/usr/local/bin/your-script.sh"]`
  - Specifies the default command to execute when a container is started.

## 3. Considerations

### 3.1 Lightweight Image
- The final image is designed to be minimal, containing only the necessary tools and the user-provided script.

### 3.2 Security
- The image follows security best practices by not running as the root user.

### 3.3 Dependency Considerations
- The script and any dependencies should be compatible with the minimal Alpine Linux environment.

### 3.4 Multi-stage Build
- Utilizes a multi-stage build to separate the build environment from the final lightweight image.

## 4. Usage

To build the Docker image, execute the following command in the directory containing the Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
```

This document provides a high-level overview of the design decisions and considerations for the Dockerfile. Adjustments may be needed based on specific use cases and requirements.

Certainly! Below is a design document outlining the purpose of the Dockerfile and the process it facilitates for bootstrapping a tooling cluster.

## Design Document: Dockerfile for Bootstrapping Tooling Cluster

### Objective:
The primary goal of this Dockerfile is to create a lightweight and efficient Docker image capable of bootstrapping a tooling cluster. The tooling cluster involves essential components like kubectl, Helm, and Kustomize, along with a custom script for generating rendered bootstrap manifests for various environments.

### Dockerfile Components:

#### Build Stage (`alpine` as builder):
- **Purpose:**
  - Installs necessary tools (`curl`, `tar`) for downloading and extracting binaries.
  - Downloads and extracts kubectl, Helm, and Kustomize binaries.

- **Actions:**
  - Uses Alpine Linux as a base image.
  - Sets the working directory to `/tmp`.
  - Installs `curl` and `tar`.
  - Copies compressed binaries (kubectl, Helm, Kustomize) into the build image.
  - Extracts binaries using `tar`.

#### Final Stage (`alpine`):
- **Purpose:**
  - Creates the final Docker image with only the necessary tools and binaries for the tooling cluster.
  - Adds a non-root user for enhanced security.

- **Actions:**
  - Uses Alpine Linux as a minimalistic base image.
  - Copies binaries from the build stage to `/usr/local/bin`.
  - Copies the custom script (`your-script.sh`) to `/usr/local/bin`.
  - Creates a non-root user (`nonrootuser`).
  - Sets the non-root user as the default user for the image.
  - Specifies the custom script (`your-script.sh`) as the default command to execute when the container starts.

### Custom Script (`your-script.sh`):
- **Purpose:**
  - Generates rendered bootstrap manifests for each environment.
  - Utilizes `kustomize` with Helm enabled to customize manifests.
  - Copies the template `manifest-kustomize.yaml` to the appropriate destination for each environment.
  - Runs `kubectl kustomize` to generate bootstrap manifests.
  - Outputs the final manifests to the `manifests` directory.

- **Script Flow:**
  - Iterates through environment folders within `envs/`.
  - For each environment, checks if it is a directory.
  - Creates a destination directory (`manifests/${cluster_folder}`).
  - Copies the template `manifest-kustomize.yaml` to the destination (`kustomization.yaml`).
  - Changes to the environment folder (`cd "${cluster_folder}"`).
  - Runs `kubectl kustomize --enable-helm` to generate bootstrap manifests.
  - Outputs the final manifests to `manifests/${cluster_folder}/bootstrap.yaml`.

### Usage:
- Build the Docker image:
  ```bash
  docker build -t tooling-cluster-bootstrap .
  ```

- Run the Docker container:
  ```bash
  docker run -it tooling-cluster-bootstrap
  ```

### Conclusion:
This Dockerfile encapsulates the essential components required for bootstrapping a tooling cluster, providing a clean and minimalistic environment for generating bootstrap manifests across various environments.

### Considerations:
- Ensure that the custom script (`your-script.sh`) and any dependencies are compatible with the minimal Alpine Linux environment.
- Handle any specific shell dependencies or compatibility issues in the custom script.
- Adjust the Dockerfile and custom script as needed based on actual project requirements and directory structures.
